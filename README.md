# Data-Management-Visualization-with-R-programming
In this project, I work in Mortality dataset with valuable skills in R programming and data science.

Explain the dataset.
In this load dataset, R programming is not showing numerical column correctly as per as I guess. so generate those column/feature my own thought.
Numerical columns- age, creatinine_phosphokinase, ejection_fraction, platelets, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, and time are numerical columns that likely represent continuous variables.
Categorical columns: anaemia, diabetes, high_blood_pressure, sex, smoking are categorical columns that likely represent binary or discrete variables.
Target variable: The last column, DEATH_EVENT, is the target variable in the dataset, which likely indicates whether an individual experienced a death event or not.
